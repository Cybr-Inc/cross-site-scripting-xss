To wrap up the course, I wanted to leave you with a number of different helpful resources. Some of these resources are one that we’ve already looked at in the course — so they should look familiar — while others are resources we haven’t looked at and that I’d recommend you read through after completing the course.

These are resources like:
- Evasion cheat sheets
- Payload cheat sheets
- Defensive cheat sheets
- Tools
- Etc..

I’m even going to include online XSS game challenges that test your ability to successfully execute payloads in vulnerable environments. 

In fact, let’s start with that!

# XSS Pwn Function
[https://xss.pwnfunction.com/](https://xss.pwnfunction.com/)
This website is pretty fun! It consists of warmups and then actual challenges where people are ranked. Try to go through these! It’ll help you think through different scenarios and how to overcome basic and flawed protections.

Then, of course, you can try the challenges!

Then, you can take it a step up with this website, which I’ve heard is supposed to be harder but admittedly I haven’t tried it yet: [http://prompt.ml/0](http://prompt.ml/0)

There are many others out there, but that’s a great place to start!
