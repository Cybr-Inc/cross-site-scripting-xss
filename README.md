# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The 2021 Guide Course
This includes free lessons from our XSS course, as well as additional resources that can help you learn and practice XSS.

Please note: performing these actions on resources you do not own or have explicit permissions for can be considered illegal and could get you in trouble. Also, performing attacks like these can cause damages to production applications, and so creating an isolated lab environment helps protect against that since we can start over if we need to, without impacting users.

Happy learning!
