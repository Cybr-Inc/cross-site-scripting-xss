Hi, I’m Christophe Limpalair, and I will be your instructor for this course. I want to take the time to thank you for enrolling and to share more details about how the course is structured, and what you will learn.

Cross-Site Scripting is one of the most serious web application security risks that we face today, and have been facing for years. But unless you understand how it works, it’s impossible to properly defend your applications.

So, the goal of this course is to give you a deep understanding of XSS, including explaining the different types of XSS:


We’ll also take a look at case studies of real-world XSS in popular applications, we’ll learn how to find vulnerabilities in web apps with tips on information gathering, manual testing, and automated testing using tools made specifically for finding XSS.

Then, we’ll take a look at how to exploit those vulnerabilities, including exploitation tools like BeEF in order to take control of a victim’s browser.

Finally, we’ll wrap up the course, by learning how to properly defend against and prevent Cross-Site Scripting in our own applications.

In my opinion, there’s no better way to learn a technical topic than to get our hands dirty and perform attacks that could happen against our own applications.

So, I’ll show you exactly how to set up the same environments and tools that I’ll be using, so you can follow along attack by attack in a safe and legal way, because I want you to get the practical experience, and to practice the concepts that you’re learning. That way, this course can become a resource that you can constantly reference throughout your development career.

We also provide a Cybr community which you can access by going to [Cybr.com/forums](https://cybr.com/forums) as long as you have an account, or that you can also join via Discord by going to [Cybr.com/discord](https://cybr.com/discord). This is a great place to ask questions, provide feedback, and engage with the rest of our cybersecurity community. We even have dedicated channels for this course specifically, so it gives you a chance to connect with other students. You can also reach me there if you have any questions or just want to say hello.


Another great way to reach me is by connecting on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophelimpalair/). I definitely spend way too much time there, so feel free to send me an invite and I’ll be happy to connect!

Alright, that’s it for this lesson! Let’s complete it, and move on.
